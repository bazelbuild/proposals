# Abstract

This section gives a short summary of the proposal.


# Background

This section can give context. For example, it can explain the current state and
have pointers to previous design documents.


# Proposal

The actual proposal. This should be detailed enough for users to understand the
change, its motivations, and the rationale. When appropriate, include rejected
alternatives (and why they were rejected).

The current file is a template. Copy it, update it to your needs. Feel free to add or
remove sections.

# Backward-compatibility

Describe here how this proposal impacts backward compatibility. If the proposal
is implemented, can it possibly break any user?
